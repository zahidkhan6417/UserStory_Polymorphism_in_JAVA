# User Story: Implement Payment System with Polymorphic Payment Methods
As a Java developer working on a financial software project, I need to implement a payment system that supports various payment methods, including credit cards, bank transfers, and digital wallets, using polymorphism to handle payments efficiently and securely.

## Acceptance Criteria:

### Define Payment Method Hierarchy:
Create a base PaymentMethod class with common attributes like amount, currency, and methods such as processPayment.
Implement subclasses for different payment methods, such as CreditCard, BankTransfer, and DigitalWallet, each overriding the processPayment method with specific payment processing logic.

### Client-Side Integration:
Integrate the payment system into the client's application, allowing users to choose their preferred payment method during checkout.
Utilize polymorphism to interact with payment objects through a common interface, abstracting the payment process for seamless integration.

### Security and Validation:
Implement security measures and validation checks specific to each payment method (e.g., credit card validation, bank account verification) within the respective subclasses.
Ensure sensitive payment information is handled securely and encrypted during transactions.

### Error Handling and Logging:
Handle exceptions and errors gracefully during payment processing, providing informative error messages to users when payments fail.
Implement logging mechanisms to record payment transactions, errors, and auditing information for troubleshooting and analytics.
